AI-Powered School Chatbot : This is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide instant, accurate information to students and parents of a school. The chatbot is a single, robust, and deployable HTML file, demonstrating a practical approach to building an AI-enabled solution for an educational environment.Key FeaturesRetrieval-Based System: The chatbot retrieves answers from a structured, internal data source, ensuring responses are always relevant and specific to the school's information.Conversational AI: The system includes advanced conversational logic to handle common greetings and questions, providing a more natural user experience.Semantic Understanding: The chatbot can interpret the meaning of a user's query and find the correct information, even if it doesn't use the exact keywords from the data.Scalable Data Structure: The data is stored in a clean, easily maintainable JavaScript object that can be extended to include complex, nested information (e.g., syllabi for different grades).Technology StackHTML5: For the application's structure.CSS (Tailwind CSS): For all styling, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface.JavaScript: For all core logic, including data retrieval and conversational handling.
Skills Demonstrated : This project showcases expertise in AI/LLM Integration: Experience in designing systems that can be powered by AI for semantic understanding and conversational abilities.Robust System Design: Building a secure, self-contained application that is not reliant on external APIs, ensuring reliability in any environment.Scalable Architecture: Creating a data structure that is easy to maintain and can be scaled for a growing amount of information, a key requirement for a production system.Front-End Development: Proficiency in building clean, responsive, and functional user interfaces.
